# GhostSpectator_NWAPI
Plugin for SCP-SL game, that allows player to become a Ghost: Tutorial, that is undetectable to alive players and has no influence on a course of the game. Depending on the config, Ghosts can perform various activities, such as teleport to alive players, practice on shooting targets or challenge another Ghost to a duel.

## Features
- Ghosts can pass through most of the doors.
- Ghosts can teleport to a random alive player by dropping a ghost item, which type is declared in the config. If the type is set to None, then player won't receive a ghost item. There is an option to exclude certain roles, that Ghosts won't be able to teleport to.
- Ghosts are always visible to each other, Spectators spactating a Ghost and Overwatchers. Depending on the config, Ghosts can be visible to Spectators spectating a non-Ghost player and Filmmakers.
- Ghosts can't pick up or use items.
- Ghosts can't interact with objects (except resetting the shooting targets).
- Depending on the assigned permissions, Ghosts can:
  * noclip
  * drop or throw items or throwables, except the ghost item
  * spawn themselves a shooting target
  * give themselves a firearm, which will be automatically refilled when emptied
  * use a Particle Disruptor 
  * listen to SCP and Spectators chats (via command or automatically)
  * listen to other Ghosts via RoundSummary chat, if they are not within Proximity Chat or further than configurable distance (via command or automatically)
  * challenge other Ghosts to a duel
- Ghosts can be resurrected by SCP-049 regardless, if they were human or SCP-0492.
